# Recommendations API

My attempt to make a full-stack application 
Uses Spotify API to make recommendations based on various parameters
Author:  Bilguun (Bill) Soronzonbold

Not all of this project was made by me, I mainly followed a tutorial on modern full stack development
by a Youtuber called Josh Tried Coding. Here's a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lUkSgvmTYM&t=310s&pp=ygUram9zaCB0cmllZCBjb2RpbmcgbmV4dGpzIGZ1bGwgc3RhY2sgcHJvamVjdA%3D%3D) to the tutorial in question. 
Go check him out because he makes good content

What I built on top of the existing project was figuring out how to use Spotify API and making the form 
that recommends music for those that aren't interested in using the API code. 

For now, I only made code that connects to NodeJS but it's not very difficult to configure the code into 
other languages. If you want more exmaples of connecting to APIs, check out [tryAPIs](https://tryapis.com/) to 
get example code in a variety of different configurations and languages.
